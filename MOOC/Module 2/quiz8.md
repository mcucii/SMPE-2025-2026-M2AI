## Quiz 8
### Why is this so difficult?
Reproducing research studies, even when they are published in prestigious journals, is often quite difficult.

1. What are the main technical causes behind the difficulties in reproducing someone else's work? (4 expected responses)

    Right answer: Lack of documentation on the choices made
    Right answer: Interactive graphical software that hide computation details 
    Right answer: Computation errors
    Right answer: Data loss (no backup or no more readable format)

    The first source of dfficulties during a replication attempt comes from a lack of information. If the procedure to obtain data is not correctly explained, or if they are kept secret, it will be difficult for a third party to check if the same conclusions can be reached. 
    Likewise, it is essential to explain the decisions made at each step of the study: which experimental protocol has been used and why, which data have been kept or completely dismissed and why, which statistical procedure has been used and if the underlying hypotheses were reasonable, etc. After all, decisions are always made at some point. (lack of documentation on the choices made)

    Among the main sources of errors, we find intuitive software in which the mouse is used to interact that do not allow explaining what is calculated nor on what these calculations are based. Their ease of use is an encouragement to use them for anything even for things they were not meant to be used for in the first place.For instance, it is very hard to understand the calculation logic in an Excel sheet full of macros. (interactive graphical software that hide computation details )

    The second source of difficulties during a replication attempt comes for the unrestrained use of computers leading to errors. Like any technological innovation, computers enable us to go faster and further but also make mistakes more easily and more quickly. (computation errors)

    The last methodological factor preventing reproducibility and leading to errors is probably lack of strictness and organization. Even if storage is very cheap today, data backup is often poorly done. It is common to lose backups after mishandlings or because of an account deletion when moving from one institution to another. (data loss)


2. Which solutions are mentioned? (3 expected responses):

    Right answer: Using a laboratory notebook
    Right answer: Code review and continuous integration
    Right answer: Using version control systems and several backup mechanisms

    They suggest using notebooks by saying "By being fully transparent regarding the decisions made, it allows others or oneself to decide if it is necessary to come back to it. In order to keep track of all these decisions and data information, notebooks are essential tools."

    They suggest using code review and continious integration in the part where they explain "Also, good practices for software development such as code review or continuous integration are still rarely applied to research software."

    They suggest using version control systems by saying "Without version control mechanisms, it is also common to replace old data by new data by mistake and become unable to access previous observations."



3. What are the most legitimate/valid fears associated with the systematic disclosure of data (open data) (2 expected responses)?

    Right answer: Some information may be sensitive and its disclosure may hurt people
    Right answer: My resources are limited. If I systematically host all this data on the web page provided by my employer, I am likely to quickly exceed my quota.
