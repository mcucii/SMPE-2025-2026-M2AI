## Quiz 6
### Recent examples of studies that have been the subject of much debate

1. In the studies we have presented to you, what prevents, sometimes for several years, the debate on the relevance of a study?

    Right answer: Unpublished computation procedures
    Right answer: Data used in the study was not released

    In the video, it is explicitely explained that the reason the debate on the Reinhart and Rogoff study didn't occur earlier was because "not all calculations methods and data had been published, a common practice among economists." Also, for the same example, it is stated that data was not released. 


2. In the various examples presented (economics, MRI, crystallography), what are the main causes of errors ?

    Right answer: Data acquisition (bias, machine calibration, etc.)
    Right answer: Computation errors
    Right answer: Inadequate data processing or statistics


    Data acquisition - In the brain imaging example, it is clearly mentioned that "The raw data obtained during an MRI has a lot of noise. Various calculations and statistical tests turn the data into images. But sometimes, there is too much noise, the machine is poorly-calibrated, the calculation procedure is not suited or signals can accidentally appear."

    Computation errors - This is stated in economics example, where they mention "obvious miscalculations in their sheets." Also, for the Crystallography example, the error was that "one analysis program had flipped two columns of data."

    Inadequate data processing or statistics - For the economics example, it is mentioned that there were a lot of mistakes of how the data was handled: "dubious data processing, data omission, suspicious weighting, etc." For the brain imaging example, as already mentioned "the calculation procedure is not suited," which corresponds to inadequate data processing. 


3. What are the consequences of lack of transparency? (4 expected responses)

    Right answer: It's difficult to rely on the work of others 
    Right answer: Articles contain less information (no details on calculations, experimental protocols, data analysis, etc.) and are therefore easier to read
    Right answer: It is difficult to verify and reproduce the analyses presented in the articles 
    Right answer: Two articles may present results that seem to contradict each other, but are both perfectly correct, as the lack of detail prevents the exact conditions of application from being determined
