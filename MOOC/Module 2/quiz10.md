## Quiz 10
### Working with others

1. What should I prepare for if I use a computational document ?
    All answers are correct.

    Right answer: By letting my co-authors easily access and modify my code, they may break everything 
    Right answer: My collaborators may realize how bad I am at writing code and how often I fiddle with my results (assuming that this is the case...;) 
    Right answer: I will have no more excuses for not rereading and checking the code of my collaborators 
    Right answer: My co-authors and I will have to make sure that it works on each of our machines and it will take us time
    Right answer: We'll have to install a lot of complicated stuff when our machines are not up to date
  

2. What are the benefits of using and publishing a computational document?
    All answers are correct.

    Right answer: These tools are relatively easy to learn, which allows as many people as possible to use them and better understand my work 
    Right answer: These tools allow to have in a single document (1) an overview of the data (2) the code (3) the computation results, and especially (4) explanations on how these three types of objects are articulated with each other
    Right answer: This makes it possible to be transparent about how we reach a particular conclusion 
    Right answer: This makes it easier for others to reuse all or part of our computation procedures 


3. How to make your computational document available in a sustainable way?

    Right answer: Gitlab, Github
    Right answer: An open archive (HAL, figshare, zenodo) 

    Dropbox is not a good option, since we have the issue with longevity, as well as Rpubs. Similar problem, we have with personal web page. Gitlab and Github are very good tools but they are not necessarily as durable as we would like. The ideal solution is an open archive. The best way to archive is probably to print the source code with archival ink on acid-free paper and have it printed by an experienced archivist who will make copies and distribute them in safe places.
